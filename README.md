# Journal Vault

A focused approach to journaling moments to remember. Based on [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md) and depends heavily on its [incredible community](https://forum.obsidian.md). 

## Features 

As a user, you'll get: 

- Automatic prompts to journal moments when you open the Vault via [QuickAdd](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd)
- Easy-to-set properties for your moments, powered by [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)
- A focused view to reflect on moments thanks to [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)
- Specialized views to review decisions and revisit incomplete thoughts

## Implementation Notes 

Views are powered by Obsidian tags. I use a specific set of them and it may be helpful to continue to use them in similar ways: 

- A `#moment` is a life event: physical time together that you want to capture details and feelings around
- A `#reflection` is more introspective memory work that may or may not relate to a specific moment
- A `#decision` is a moment of choice with a particular set of knowledge and beliefs
- The `#revisit` tag is for incomplete thoughts that you are not ready to label as one of the above or with specific emotions

There are a number of CSS snippets I've accumulated along the way that I reuse with thanks to the originator.

## How To Use

- Download this repository
- Install Obsidian
- Open the repository as a Vault

From there, consider what will work best to sync with your phone. You can use the native Sync service from Obsidian or [one of the many alternatives](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Sync+your+notes+across+devices).
